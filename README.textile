This is a sample Rails 3 app tooled to use js-model, Sammy.js & haml-js as a clientside mvc framework.

pre. bundle install
rails server

The javascript app is served in a single file.

pre. localhost:3000/javascripts/app.js

Models & controllers are stored in app/javascripts just like a rails app.

pre. models/events.js
controllers/events_controller.js

Views are stored in public/javascripts/app/views/events/index.haml. Still evaluating js templating options.

There is nothing in the rails app, filling those views with data is left up to the viewer.
